# EEG-SHIELD

Electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition system. Using TI's ADS1299-4 low noise, programmable gain amplifier, 4 channel ADC.
The data is sent to a PC using SPI (raspberry pi in this case) to view measured signals. In order to not lose any bits of data, 
we use a microcontroller (ESP32) to interface with the ADS1299 and relay information to the Raspberry Pi 3B+ (because the RPi is busy interrupting since it is running an OS).

## üõ† Tools Used

- KiCad version: 9
- Python 3
- Arduino-cli (cli version of Arduino IDE, less laggy, works with neovim)
  - Look for file `compile-upload-monitor.sh` to see how

---

## üèó How to Build / Order

1. Open the `.kicad_pro` project in KiCad 9.
2. Swap that LDO, modify its traces correctly.
3. Generate Gerber files with KiCad's Fabrication tool.

---

## üì¶ BOM (Bill of Materials)
### IMPORTANT
- The RPi extension connector is a 24 pin connector, not a 20...
- The parts are ordered in 2x, 3x, in case you lose/break the part or they're bad.
- Need electrodes and abrasive low imped gel
- TPS73225DBVR missing in the BOM (board will short if you use 2 TPS72325DBVR instead of a TPS72325DBVR and a TPS73225DBVR)
- The BOM is missing the ESP32 socket, buy 2 1x19 PinSocket Headers, 2.54 mm pitch per board, or 1x20 and cut the extra off)
